/* These lines of code are exporting three constants: ADD_TO_CART, REMOVE_FROM_CART, and CART_RESET.
These constants are likely being used in a Redux store to manage the state of a shopping cart.
ADD_TO_CART is likely dispatched when a user adds an item to their cart, REMOVE_FROM_CART is
dispatched when a user removes an item from their cart, and CART_RESET is dispatched when a user
clears their entire cart. */
